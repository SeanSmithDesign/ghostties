# Ghostties

**A multi-agent workspace terminal — built on [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty)**

> **Work in Progress** — This project is in active early development.

## What is Ghostties?

Ghostties is a fork of [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty), the fast, native, feature-rich terminal emulator. The goal is to add native workspace management for running multiple AI agents side-by-side — giving you a single terminal experience for multi-agent workflows.

For core terminal emulator documentation, downloads, and configuration, see the [upstream Ghostty repo](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) and [ghostty.org](https://ghostty.org/docs).
